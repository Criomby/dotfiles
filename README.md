This repo contains my config files for the various tools I use.

Take what you need and if you have any questions open a discussion.

# setup

- sway (window manager)
- swaylock (lock screen)
- swayidle (lock screen timeout & display off when locked)
- waybar (bar)
- foot (terminal, alacritty for ssh since foot gave me some weird behavior there)
- gdm (login manager)
- kickoff (application menu/launcher)

# utility

- wl-gammarelay-rs (display brightness + temperature)
- nmtui (network manager terminal ui)
- bluetuith (bluetooth manager terminal ui)
- grim (screenshots)
- bat (`cat` replacement)

# TODO

- notifications (dunst or SwayNotificationCenter)
- external display manager (nwg-displays) but works pretty well as-is
